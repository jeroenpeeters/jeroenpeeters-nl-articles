# Java Code Coverage with Eclemma

When writing unit tests it is important to understand which parts of your code are covered by the tests. In general software development companies have quality control systems in place which keep track of, amongst other things, unit test coverage. Normally a developer needs to commit code to the version control system before the code is analyzed by the quality system.


I like to stay in control of my code and knowing the quality of my code before committing it is a must for me! Iâ€™m using the code coverage tool JaCoCo for over a year now and I am very happy with the detailed coverage reports that it generates.

If you ever wondered what the coverage of your unit tests is I would recommend using JaCoCo. You can use it as a standalone tool or as a plugin in Eclipse.

EclEmma is an Eclipse plugin for the popular code coverage tool JaCoCo. Previous versions of EclEmma used Emma as code coverage tool, hence the name. Active development of Emma seized some years ago. The authors of EclEmma developed JaCoCo to be a drop-in replacement of Emma, with functional enhancements like branch coverage. At time of writing JaCoCo is the only coverage tool with full support for Java 7.
